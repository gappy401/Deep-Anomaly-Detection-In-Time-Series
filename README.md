# Deep Industrial IoT Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data 

## Abstract
In this paper, I explore some deep learning methodologies for detecting anomalies in time series data. I utilised approaches from my study of the paper [Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Internet of Things](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9348249). Building on the concepts from the paper, I integrated an attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network long short-term memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to effectively capture critical features in time series data, addressing issues such as memory loss and gradient dispersion. Additionally, I explored a gradient compression mechanism to improve communication efficiency within the federated learning setup. This work aims to adapt these advanced methodologies to the specific challenges of industrial anomaly detection, focusing on scalability, noise reduction, and class imbalance while ensuring privacy preservation and timely detection.

## 1. Introduction

The widespread deployment of edge devices in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has revolutionized industries by enabling real-time, flexible, and quick decision-making capabilities across various applications, such as smart manufacturing, intelligent transportation, and logistics. However, this rapid expansion has introduced critical security risks, particularly from abnormal behaviors in IIoT nodes, which can cause significant disruptions and economic losses. For example, in smart manufacturing, industrial devices that exhibit abnormal traffic or irregular reporting can interrupt production and lead to substantial financial setbacks.

Detecting these anomalies is increasingly crucial, particularly as edge devices continuously collect and analyze vast amounts of time-series data. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle with the complexity and volume of data in these scenarios. Furthermore, privacy concerns complicate the situation, as edge devices are reluctant to share raw data, leading to "data islands" that hinder collaborative anomaly detection efforts.


In my study, I explore advanced methodologies to enhance anomaly detection in time series data. Specifically, I adapt the proposed framework to a new dataset, investigating the generalizability and robustness of deep learning models across different contexts. My approach incorporates various deep learning techniques, including Autoencoders, LSTM Networks, CNN-LSTM models, and Attention Mechanisms, to address challenges such as imbalanced data, noise, and scalability. Additionally, I implemented model specific gradient compression mechanism to reduce communication overhead, ensuring the model's efficiency in distributed environments. 

My process involved exploring the data with techniques like variance inflation factor (VIF) and principal component analysis (PCA) to remove redundant features, cross-verifying with Lasso, and then employing a series of models—SAE, SVM, GRU, CNN, LSTM-CNN, and Attention Mechanism LSTM CNN. By applying these models to a different time series dataset, I aim to validate their effectiveness and adaptability beyond the original study's scope, contributing to the development of robust, scalable anomaly detection solutions for IIoT applications.

### 2.1 Traditional Anomaly Detection Methods
Classical methods such as Statistical Methods, Isolation Forests, and One-Class SVMs are less effective for anomaly detection in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) sensors due to their limitations in handling high-dimensional, complex, and noisy data typical in IIoT environments. These methods require extensive manual feature engineering, struggle with scalability, and are not well-suited for real-time processing, making them less effective for detecting anomalies in IIoT settings. For instance, a [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40745-021-00362-9) highlights that traditional anomaly detection methods often fall short in capturing the intricate patterns in IIoT sensor data, which are better addressed by advanced models like deep learning frameworks that can learn from data automatically and operate efficiently at scale​.

### 2.2 Deep Learning Approaches
In my study, I applied existing deep learning techniques such as Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for anomaly detection, as detailed in the referenced paper. These models are particularly effective in IIoT environments because they can automatically extract features from raw data and capture complex temporal dependencies, making them more suitable for time series anomaly detection. Additionally, I refined the dataset by conducting feature selection and dimensionality reduction, using techniques like PCA and VIF to remove redundant features, ensuring the models were trained on the most relevant and streamlined data. This refinement process improved the models' efficiency and accuracy, allowing for better generalization to unseen data.

### 3.1 Data Description
We utilize a time series dataset from an Industrial IoT environment. The dataset includes various sensor readings, such as TP2 (compressor pressure), DV_pressure, Oil_temperature, Motor_current, DV_eletric, Towers, LPS, Oil_level, Caudal_impulses, and a label for anomalies (`anomalous_hour`). Anomalies are detected based on predefined thresholds or expert annotations. Preprocessing steps include data normalization, handling missing values, and converting timestamps to a standard format.

### 3.2 Model Architecture
- **Autoencoders**: A deep autoencoder architecture is employed with multiple encoder and decoder layers to compress and reconstruct the input data. Anomalies are detected based on reconstruction error.
- **LSTM Networks**: LSTMs are used to capture temporal dependencies. The model is trained to predict the next time step, and anomalies are detected when the prediction error exceeds a threshold.
- **CNN-LSTM Models**: Combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and LSTMs, this architecture captures both spatial and temporal features. CNN layers extract spatial features, while LSTM layers model temporal dependencies.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Integrated into LSTM networks to improve detection accuracy by focusing on relevant parts of the time series data.

### 3.3 Training and Evaluation
The models are trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Cross-entropy loss is used for classification tasks, and mean squared error for reconstruction tasks. Evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC. Special attention is given to handling class imbalance and noisy data. Data augmentation techniques and advanced preprocessing methods, such as resampling and handling warnings related to chained assignment, are applied to improve model robustness.
